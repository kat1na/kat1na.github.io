## THIS WEBSITE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
You heard it right here and right now! Much of my online presence is still new and unfinished. I've been applying for adjunct and tutoring positions, so I put this website up to show that I'm serious! I started working on this website in April, personal life as always, got in the way, and now I've gotten back to working on this website and polishing my online presence. 
### A note on my former identity crisis
You might have known me by a few names - Mugen, Tina, br1o, kat1na-is-online, Jin... It became too much of a pain to try to find a "hacker handle" or a pseudonym so I'm just going by my real name now. It's easier that way - and sometimes people struggled with my names, got confused, etc... So I gave up! Call me Katina!
