## Right now I'm learning about...
1. More in-depth PingDirectory administration, so I can become a PingDirectory Advanced System Administrator (this is a certification).
2. Python 3 on Codecademy, so I can write my own Anki plugins to study for certification exams. 
3. Mathematics on KhanAcademy, so I can rekindle my love of math and become a math tutor.

## Here are some concepts I would like to learn about in the near future...
1. Full-stack web development, so I can better understand how the webapps we use everday work.
2. Java programming, so I can understand the backbones behind popular IAM software like SailPoint and PingIdentity. 
3. The cloud! I want to learn about AWS and Azure administration so I can understand some of the infrastructure that runs the world.
