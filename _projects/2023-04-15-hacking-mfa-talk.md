title: Hacking Multifactor Authentication Talk - March 28th 2023
---

My first security talk at OWASP Delaware! See the video below:

I decided to work on this talk because as an IAM Consultant, I work with and implement MFA everyday. I was curious about how you could potentially break it. I wanted to be able to inform my clients of the potential risks of implementing MFA if they asked about them - most never do! 

A follow up blog-post will be coming soon where I dive deeper into trying to phish a yubikey AND a step-by-step guide on how to set up your own phishing server using Evilginx 2 and AWS.

Really hoping I can give this talk at other conferences and organizations. In the future, I may be giving this talk at OWASP Princeton (and no, not the school. not that fancy) - and I applied to give this talk at Cyberjutsu Con 2023. Fingers crossed!
